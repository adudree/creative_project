        <h2>Our concept</h2>
        <p>We are two musicians who love music and share it to the other. So, having the possibility to integrate music in an artistic and programming class project was really inspiring to us.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, when we create our own melody, we have a start in our heads, but we don't know how to finish it. So, we created Melod'IMAC, a website where people can enter the melody they want and wait for the computer to calculate the end of it by magic! By this really simple concept, we hope to help you to develop your creativity and music skills, while playing with a real artificial intelligence based on Machine Learning.</p>
